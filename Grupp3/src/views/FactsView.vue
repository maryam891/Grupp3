    <h1>Here are some fun facts about each planet in our solar system, including Pluto:</h1>
    <div class="planet-info">

      Mercury: The smallest planet and closest to the Sun, Mercury experiences extreme temperature fluctuations, ranging from scorching heat during the day to freezing cold at night.
    </div>
    <div class="planet-info">
      Venus: Similar in size to Earth, Venus has a toxic atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide and surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead, making it the hottest planet.
    </div>

    <div class="planet-info">
      Earth: The only known planet to support life, Earth's surface is 71% water. It has a protective atmosphere that shields it from harmful solar radiation.
    </div>

    <div class="planet-info">
      Mars: Known as the Red Planet due to its iron oxide-rich soil, Mars hosts the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, and has seasons similar to Earth.
    </div>

    <div class="planet-info">
      Jupiter: The largest planet, Jupiter is famous for its Great Red Spot, a massive storm system larger than Earth, and has at least 79 moons, including the large Galilean moons.
    </div>

    <div class="planet-info">
      Saturn: Distinguished by its prominent ring system composed of ice particles, rocky debris, and dust, Saturn is less dense than water, meaning it would float if placed in a large enough body of water.
    </div>

    <div class="planet-info">
      Uranus: Unique for its tilted axis, Uranus rotates on its side, leading to extreme seasonal variations. Its atmosphere contains methane, giving it a blue-green color.
    </div>

    <div class="planet-info">
      Neptune: The farthest known planet from the Sun, Neptune has the fastest winds in the solar system, reaching speeds over 1,200 miles per hour (2,000 kilometers per hour).
    </div>

    <div class="planet-info">
      Pluto: Once considered the ninth planet, Pluto is now classified as a dwarf planet. It has five known moons, with Charon being the largest, nearly half the size of Pluto itself.
